\scene Student 1 and Student 2 are sitting at a table, discussing the current assignment, with a laptop in front of them. *Lights up*

S1:
This makes no sense to me. Explain how to use max flow to find the maximum bipartite matching in a bipartite graph, and prove its correctness using the min-cut max flow theorem?! I donât even know what bipartitis is?!

S2:
Well you knowâ¦ There is alwaysâ¦ *looks around, making sure nobody else is present* â¦ that option.

S1:
You donât meanâ¦ *looks around, making sure nobody else is present* â¦ that option?..

S2:
Yes I meanâ¦ *both looks around, making sure nobody else is present* â¦ that optionâ¦ *takes the laptop, types furiously*

(OverTex:)
*Opens ChatGPT*

S2:
You know what to doâ¦ *gives the laptop back to Student 1*

S1:
Well.. Donât mind if I do *types furiously*

(OverTex:)
*Asks ChatGPT the aforementioned question, and copies the result into a document*

S1:
And thatâs that!

TA:
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE

S2:
OH NO, THE TA!

S1:
*Smacks the laptop*

Oh how nice! The grading is here. I guess it is time for me to start coming up with the next assignment then.

Professor:
And Chat is already open?...

Professor:
*looks around, making sure nobody else is present*

Professor:
Wellâ¦ Donât mind if I.. 

Professor:
No.. you know what? Screw it. Iâll just reuse last yearâs assignment.
